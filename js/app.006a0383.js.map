psychological and social issues that continue to persist through\\ngenerations even though the schools themselves are gone, and many of those problems haven’t been addressed officially by the\\ngovernment. As you read through this article, you will learn the degree to which these problems still exist, as well as see\\nsome of the proposed solutions, and the sheer number of them that the government has considered and then thrown aside. This\\narticle will also touch on what these proposed solutions might do to help Indigenous people, as well as the official responses\\nand reasons for lack of action on some of them. Overall, by the time you’re finished this, you’ll understand the current\\nstate of the restoration efforts for residential schools, as well as where those efforts could be if the proposed solutions\\nwere implemented. <br>\\n\\nIf this article seems too long, feel free to read through the summary at the bottom instead. <br>\\n\\n<img\\nhttps://ehprnh2mwo3.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NCTR-Survivors-Flag-PRINTsm3.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&w=1152&ssl=1\\n> <class text-center fst-italic;The Survivors' Flag> <br>\\n\\nTo understand the propositions for reconciliation and reparation, we first need to know what exactly needs to be reconciled\\nand repaired. To start, there’s the idea of intergenerational trauma, where residential school survivors lack the experience\\nof being parented, so they can’t properly parent their own children and often end up perpetuating the cycle of abuse and\\nmanipulation that they experienced as students. This is a recent concept, as research on it only really began in the 2010’s.\\nThat research has since shown similar effects to that of Holocaust survivors’ children, like difficulties identifying with\\ntheir own culture, that stem from the stripping of that culture from their parents that was seen in residential schools.\\nThere’s also the matter of the subpar education that survivors were left with, which left them unfit for most jobs and put\\nthem into a cycle of generational poverty. There are other issues, of course, and while these two issues aren’t nearly\\nuniversal, they are the most common issues faced by Indigenous descendants of survivors of residential schools. <br>\\n\\nThe government has put things into place to help with these issues and other discrimination-related ones, the majority of\\nwhich came in 2007 with the creation of the Indian Residential School Settlement Agreement. This class-action settlement\\nconsisted of 5 parts, each with their own separate funding and goals: <br>\\n\\n<list cw-5-2-5 Section; Funding; Purpose;;\\nCommon Experience Payment; Exact amount unknown; Send a lump-sum payout of $10k to each residential school survivor, plus $3k for each year spent in residential school beyond the first.;;\\nIndependent Assessment Process; $1.7b; Create a system for out-of-court settlement of abuse claims and similar issues.;;\\nTruth and Reconciliation Commission; $72m; Produce a report detailing what the government must do for the reconciliation efforts.;;\\nCommemoration; $20m; Acknowledge the full impact of residential schools and uncover the hidden things that happened there.;;\\nHealth and Healing Services; $125m; Help the survivors work through any mental health problems they may have as a result of their schooling.;;\\n> <br>\\n\\nSadly, this system does see a lot of abuse, such as instances of lawyers charging more than they usually would simply because\\nthey can. The agreement also completely excluded Newfoundland and Labrador, as in the time of residential schools, they were not\\ntechnically a part of Canada. As you can see, while there is some amount of policy in place to help reparations, it has its flaws. <br>\\n\\nThe government-prescribed measures for reconciliation do help, but overall, they don’t do nearly enough. The 94 Calls to Action,\\nwhich were the focus of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s report, were technically “accepted” by the federal government,\\nbut as of yet very few of them have actually been implemented. The government has had 7 years to work on them, but they still \\nhaven't completed more than 13 and haven’t started more than another 29. That leaves 32 with only proposed action and another\\n20 with nothing at all. Most of the proposed solutions don’t even do what they’re supposed to, as they often ignore the problems\\nfacing Indigenous people today in favor of picking at those in the past. Other measures do exist in the 94 calls to action that\\nwould address these current issues, but they haven’t seen progress. This severe lack of action has caused a lot of shock among\\nIndigenous communities, and some of those groups even say they don’t see what the government’s goals are supposed to be, as they\\ncontinue to fight in court over the rights they’ve already been given, never mind those that others have. These people cite the\\nlack of acknowledgement of basic human rights like water, education, and physical safety, as evidence that the right to have these\\nthings is distributed unfairly, with others getting more while they get none. The severe lack of effort by the government towards\\nenacting these 94 calls to action properly and fairly contributes greatly to this massive inequality. <br>\\n\\n<img https://curn.trubox.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/635/2022/01/Underway.png>\\n<class text-center fst-italic;Progress on the 94 Calls> <br>\\n\\nThe 94 calls to action include many proposed solutions to the problems that Indigenous people face, but those ideas haven’t been\\nconsidered yet, and so they remain just that, ideas. Until they are implemented, the benefits they would confer are entirely\\ntheoretical. As a few examples, consider these: <br>\\n\\n<list cw-2-5-5 C2A; Summary; Status;;\\nC2A #3; The government must implement Jordan’s Principle, the idea that Indigenous children should be given the same access\\nto public services that any others receive; Partially resolved.;;\\nC2A #6; The government must remove the section of the Criminal Code that allows teachers to be physically violent with their\\nstudents for various reasons; Not started.;;\\n> <br>\\n\\nIt’s not all so incomplete, though. They have made some progress. Here’s a chart of that, organized by the call to action’s\\ncategory: <br>\\n\\n<list cw-6-3-3 Category; Number Completed; Percentage;;\\nChild Welfare; 1/5; 20%;;\\nEducation; 0/5; 0%;;\\nLanguage and Culture; 2/5; 40%;;\\nHealth; 0/7; 0%;;\\nJustice; 0/21; 0%;;\\nGeneral Reconciliation; 9/45; 20%;;\\nTotal; 12/94; 13%;;\\n> <br>\\n\\n<img https://curn.trubox.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/635/2022/01/94-Calls-to-action-graphic.png>\\n<class text-center fst-italic; The 6 sections of the 94 Calls to Action>\\n\\nLooking at that, you can see how much room for improvement there is. Over the course of the rest of this article, there will\\nbe several examples of specific calls to action that the government could be working on, but isn’t, to illustrate this point. <br>\\n\\nYou may be wondering why these policies haven’t been implemented, and while we can’t see inside government officials’ minds,\\nwe do have their official statements as to the reasons for their inaction. Here are some examples: <br>\\n\\n<list cw-2-5-5 C2A; Summary; Reason;;\\nC2A #25; The government must allow the RCMP to investigate things that may incriminate past governments; The government has released a “Mandate Letter” regarding this and claims that that is enough, but they have yet to release any formal policy regarding this, so the issue remains.;;\\nC2A #58; The government must petition the Pope to formally apologize on behalf of the church for what happened in the residential schools; They have done this, but while the Pope has released several apologies since, none of them really address the required issues.;;\\nC2A #89; The government must amend the Physical Activity and Sport Act to improve its inclusivity to Indigenous people and activities; They government claimed in an official statement that “longer-term consultation with stakeholders is needed.”;;\\n> <br>\\n\\nAs you can see from these, the government often decides that they have completed a call to action when they haven’t even done\\nanything substantial. This is a problem, because no matter how effective these measures may be, Canada won’t see any of their\\neffects if government officials aren’t willing to complete them. <br>\\n\\nThere is the question, for some of these measures, of whether they’d do anything relevant to the cause. There are so many more\\nthat haven’t been considered for other reasons, though, so here are some of those: <br>\\n\\n<list cw-2-5-5 C2A; Summary; Purpose;;\\nC2A #18; The government must acknowledge the part that they play in the current state of Aboriginal healthcare and must recognize\\nthe rights that they’ve ignored; This would help greatly in the process of reparation, as recognition must always be the first\\nstep. Also, many of these rights that Indigenous people have been denied access to are things that others are receiving at the\\nexpected rate, which speaks to exactly what that current state of government involvement is.;;\\nC2A #14; The government must create an Aboriginal Languages Act, including the recognition of the cultural value of Aboriginal\\nlanguages and the implementation of a plan for their revitalization; Language is a part of culture, so protecting one means\\nprotecting the other. If the country wants to protect Indigenous culture, we’ll need their languages to survive.;;\\nC2A #26; The government must amend their Statutes of Limitation to stop them from justifying the Aboriginal abuse committed in\\nresidential schools; Few of these cases are made any more “correct” by the continued existence of these policies, and to reject\\nthem all without consideration of circumstances is wrong.;;\\nC2A #8; The government must eliminate the discrepancy between funding for on- and off-reserve Indigenous education; This is\\nunquestionably necessary, as until Indigenous people are truly free to express their culture in any place without losing out\\non the things that others receive, it can’t reasonably be said that they are given the same opportunity as others.;;\\n> <br>\\n\\nReading through these should give some perspective on just how much these calls to action cover, and just how important it is\\nthat they are implemented. <br>\\n\\nThere’s still the issue of how exactly these policies would be enacted, as without a plan we can’t do anything with them.\\nLuckily, there are a lot of calls to action for which this isn’t the case. Most of the calls ask for something very specific,\\nand there’s a clear process that would be involved with completing them. For some examples, see the following: <br>\\n\\n<list cw-2-5-5 C2A; Summary; Action;;\\nC2A #9; The government must release annual reports that compare the funding that on- and off-reserve education receives, as\\nwell as the average income of Aboriginals and others; This call to action is direct, to-the-point, and all that’s needed to\\npull it off is a small committee and a minor amount of funding per year.;;\\nC2A #30; The government must commit to reducing the percentage of Indigenous people in custody to a number that better reflects\\ntheir overall population, and monitor this percentage over the next 10 years; This is another simple case of “make a committee,\\ngive them some funding, and let them tell you how you’re doing,” with a couple of policies added on to help Indigenous people\\navoid a criminal lifestyle and to stop the overpolicing that they see.;;\\nC2A #47; The government must deny the things that were used to justify European ownership of Indigenous property and people,\\nlike the Doctrine of Discovery; This doesn’t even need any new policy, just the removal of some old ones that weren’t even\\nreally laws to begin with!;;\\n> <br>\\n\\nClearly, there are several easy starting points for these calls to action. For some reason, though, the government seems set\\non not taking any of them, or many other easy yet relevant options. That must seem at least a little strange. <br>\\n\\n<img https://librarianship.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/93.jpg> <class text-center fst-italic; An example of a call to action>\\n\\nOne potential explanation for the government’s vast inaction on these 94 things they’ve agreed to do is that they would simply\\ntake more effort than they’d return in value. While that could be seen through some lens as valid, there are plenty of\\ncounterexamples. For instance, there are these: <br>\\n\\n<list cw-2-5-5 C2A; Summary; Is it Reasonable?;;\\nC2A #18; The government must acknowledge the part that they play in the current state of Aboriginal healthcare and must recognize the rights that they’ve ignored; This one has been covered earlier in this article, but government acknowledgement of this issue is so important that it seems reasonable to talk about it twice. The government officials’ predecessors are at fault for a lot of this, and while they continue to be inactive on it, so are they.;;\\nC2A #32; The government must change their criminal code to allow judges to ignore the minimum sentence for specific crimes; If the duty of a court is to decide on reasonable sentences for crimes, is it not reasonable to allow them to decide on less if they believe that the defendant deserves less, especially if they aren’t entirely morally at fault?;;\\nC2A #3; The government must implement Jordan’s Principle, the idea that Indigenous children should be given the same access to public services that any others receive; This is another call to action that is important enough that it’s deserving of more than one entry discussing it. It’s also a member of the small set of calls that are being actively worked on, which would be good if any real progress were being made. Though technically it’s “in progress,” not a whole lot is getting done. Either way, the full completion of this one would have a huge impact on the current state of reconciliation. The path back to equality includes finding it for children, too.;;\\n> <br>\\n\\nWith that in mind, any questions of usefulness for effort should have landed squarely on the side of “these are worthwhile and\\nwould give more than enough value to make up for what was expended to get there.” <br>\\nUltimately, the government could be doing a lot more than they currently are. One big thing to think about, then, is this:\\nSuppose that they did take more action on these 94, enough that they complete them all in the relatively near future. Although\\nnobody can see the future, here’s what seems like the most likely outcome based on current evidence. Firstly, the main thing that\\nthe 94 calls to action aim for is to aid the Indigenous healing process from colonization and from residential schools, and they\\nwould be very efficient at accomplishing that if they were implemented. There are two main ways that they are intended to do this,\\nthose being the acknowledgement of the full history of these events, and the creation of a system to reduce the longstanding\\nnegative impacts that they’ve left behind. If the Indigenous population were to receive the proper help that they deserve from\\nthe government, it’s likely that the relationship between the two groups would improve greatly, as a lot of the tensions that\\nexist between them are due to the lack of real handling of these issues. Overall, if Canada managed to reach all these 94 targets\\nthat have been set out for them, the country would be a much more equal place, at least legally speaking. While that doesn’t\\nnecessarily imply true social equality, it’s certainly a necessary first step. <br>\\n\\nAfter reading through all of this, I hope that you recognize the extent to which the Canadian government is ignoring its many\\noptions for reconciliation, but as a final thought, what might be the holdup? This was covered to some extent earlier, but to\\ngive a better analysis of it, it needs to be looked at more generally, to see the trends. As it stands, there are a lot of\\ncases where the government chooses to believe that they have completed a call to action when they’ve accomplished very little.\\nThis was discussed earlier, but another big issue is that sometimes when the federal government releases an answer to a call\\nto action, it takes the provincial and regional governments an unnecessary amount of time to recognize it themselves. For\\ninstance, when the federal government marked Truth and Reconciliation Day, very few of the provinces chose to do the same,\\nand in a lot of cases it still doesn’t apply to everyone. Clearly, there’s a problem somewhere, as if the government can’t\\neven do the things that they’ve already decided on for reconciliation, something must have broken down. In conclusion, the\\nefforts to put an end to the damage caused by colonizers’ actions are left far behind where they should be, and it’s left\\nIndigenous people in a state of severe inequality with seemingly no government effort to help them escape they cycles that\\nthey’ve been put in. <br>\\n\\n<class fw-bold text-center fs-3; TL, DR:\\n    <class text-center; The next passage is meant to summarize everything that has been discussed in this article.>\\n>\\nThe issues caused by residential schools didn’t simply end with their survivors. They continue to persist in a very real\\nway to this day, and they aren’t going to go away if nothing is done about them. To help combat these issues, which include\\nthings like a cycle of parents abusing their children, generation-spanning poverty, and a continued prejudice held by many\\npeople against their very culture, the government created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which in turn released\\na report containing 94 calls to action and had the government agree that they would put effort into reaching each of their\\ngoals. In the 7 years since, the government hasn’t completed more than 14 of them, and has only started work on another 23.\\nThere seems to be no reason for this, as the calls aren’t inherently unreasonable, and if completed, they would be highly\\neffective in aiding the reconciliation efforts. It seems that the only reason that they aren’t being completed is that the\\ngovernment has chosen not to add it to their set of priorities. That and the set of calls that they claim to have completed\\nbut have barely started. They have the funding, they have the people who want it, and they can tell whether they’ve reached\\nthe goals or not, even though they choose not to use it, so it’s unclear what they are waiting for. Until we see substantial\\nprogress, it can only be assumed that they won’t act on these calls, and that they won’t give a direct reason for it, so one\\nbig thing that you can do after considering all of this is to investigate why exactly it is that they haven’t done what they\\ncan to help. Maybe you’ll even find something that gives you reason to consider taking action yourself. <br>\\n\\n<class fw-bold text-center fs-3; Sources>\\nMenzies, Peter. “Intergenerational Trauma and Residential Schools | the Canadian Encyclopedia.” Thecanadianencyclopedia.ca,\\n25 Mar. 2020, thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/intergenerational-trauma-and-residential-schools. <br>\\nMiller, J.R. “Residential Schools in Canada | the Canadian Encyclopedia.” Thecanadianencyclopedia.ca, 10 Oct. 2012,\\nthecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/residential-schools. <br>\\nde Bruin, Tabitha. “Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement | the Canadian Encyclopedia.” Thecanadianencyclopedia.ca,\\nthecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/indian-residential-schools-settlement-agreement. <br>\\nSterritt, Angela. “Reconciliation in Canada | the Canadian Encyclopedia.” Thecanadianencyclopedia.ca,\\n16 Dec, 2020, thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/reconciliation-in-canada. <br>\\nBCTreaty Admin. “94 Calls to Action | BC Treaty Commission.” Bctreaty.ca, bctreaty.ca/94-calls-action. <br>\\nSawchuk, Joe. “Social Conditions of Indigenous Peoples in Canada | the Canadian Encyclopedia.” Thecanadianencyclopedia.ca,\\n27 May 2020, thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/native-people-social-conditions. <br>\\nTruth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada.
