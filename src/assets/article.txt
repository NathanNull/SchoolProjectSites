Residential schools have caused Indigenous people a lot of psychological and social issues that continue to persist through
generations even though the schools themselves are gone, and many of those problems haven’t been addressed officially by the
government. As you read through this article, you will learn the degree to which these problems still exist, as well as see
some of the proposed solutions, and the sheer number of them that the government has considered and then thrown aside. This
article will also touch on what these proposed solutions might do to help Indigenous people, as well as the official responses
and reasons for lack of action on some of them. Overall, by the time you’re finished this, you’ll understand the current
state of the restoration efforts for residential schools, as well as where those efforts could be if the proposed solutions
were implemented. <br>

If this article seems too long, feel free to read through the summary at the bottom instead. <br>

> <class text-center fst-italic;The Survivors' Flag> <br>

To understand the propositions for reconciliation and reparation, we first need to know what exactly needs to be reconciled
and repaired. To start, there’s the idea of intergenerational trauma, where residential school survivors lack the experience
of being parented, so they can’t properly parent their own children and often end up perpetuating the cycle of abuse and
manipulation that they experienced as students. This is a recent concept, as research on it only really began in the 2010’s.
That research has since shown similar effects to that of Holocaust survivors’ children, like difficulties identifying with
their own culture, that stem from the stripping of that culture from their parents that was seen in residential schools.
There’s also the matter of the subpar education that survivors were left with, which left them unfit for most jobs and put
them into a cycle of generational poverty. There are other issues, of course, and while these two issues aren’t nearly
universal, they are the most common issues faced by Indigenous descendants of survivors of residential schools. <br>

The government has put things into place to help with these issues and other discrimination-related ones, the majority of
which came in 2007 with the creation of the Indian Residential School Settlement Agreement. This class-action settlement
consisted of 5 parts, each with their own separate funding and goals: <br>

<list cw-5-2-5 Section; Funding; Purpose;;
Common Experience Payment; Exact amount unknown; Send a lump-sum payout of $10k to each residential school survivor, plus $3k for each year spent in residential school beyond the first.;;
Independent Assessment Process; $1.7b; Create a system for out-of-court settlement of abuse claims and similar issues.;;
Truth and Reconciliation Commission; $72m; Produce a report detailing what the government must do for the reconciliation efforts.;;
Commemoration; $20m; Acknowledge the full impact of residential schools and uncover the hidden things that happened there.;;
Health and Healing Services; $125m; Help the survivors work through any mental health problems they may have as a result of their schooling.;;
> <br>

Sadly, this system does see a lot of abuse, such as instances of lawyers charging more than they usually would simply because
they can. The agreement also completely excluded Newfoundland and Labrador, as in the time of residential schools, they were not
technically a part of Canada. As you can see, while there is some amount of policy in place to help reparations, it has its flaws. <br>

The government-prescribed measures for reconciliation do help, but overall, they don’t do nearly enough. The 94 Calls to Action,
which were the focus of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s report, were technically “accepted” by the federal government,
but as of yet very few of them have actually been implemented. The government has had 7 years to work on them, but they still 
haven't completed more than 13 and haven’t started more than another 29. That leaves 32 with only proposed action and another
20 with nothing at all. Most of the proposed solutions don’t even do what they’re supposed to, as they often ignore the problems
facing Indigenous people today in favor of picking at those in the past. Other measures do exist in the 94 calls to action that
would address these current issues, but they haven’t seen progress. This severe lack of action has caused a lot of shock among
Indigenous communities, and some of those groups even say they don’t see what the government’s goals are supposed to be, as they
continue to fight in court over the rights they’ve already been given, never mind those that others have. These people cite the
lack of acknowledgement of basic human rights like water, education, and physical safety, as evidence that the right to have these
things is distributed unfairly, with others getting more while they get none. The severe lack of effort by the government towards
enacting these 94 calls to action properly and fairly contributes greatly to this massive inequality. <br>

<class text-center fst-italic;Progress on the 94 Calls> <br>

The 94 calls to action include many proposed solutions to the problems that Indigenous people face, but those ideas haven’t been
considered yet, and so they remain just that, ideas. Until they are implemented, the benefits they would confer are entirely
theoretical. As a few examples, consider these: <br>

<list cw-2-5-5 C2A; Summary; Status;;
C2A #3; The government must implement Jordan’s Principle, the idea that Indigenous children should be given the same access
to public services that any others receive; Partially resolved.;;
C2A #6; The government must remove the section of the Criminal Code that allows teachers to be physically violent with their
students for various reasons; Not started.;;
> <br>

It’s not all so incomplete, though. They have made some progress. Here’s a chart of that, organized by the call to action’s
category: <br>

<list cw-6-3-3 Category; Number Completed; Percentage;;
Child Welfare; 1/5; 20%;;
Education; 0/5; 0%;;
Language and Culture; 2/5; 40%;;
Health; 0/7; 0%;;
Justice; 0/21; 0%;;
General Reconciliation; 9/45; 20%;;
Total; 12/94; 13%;;

<class text-center fst-italic; The 6 sections of the 94 Calls to Action>

Looking at that, you can see how much room for improvement there is. Over the course of the rest of this article, there will
be several examples of specific calls to action that the government could be working on, but isn’t, to illustrate this point. <br>

You may be wondering why these policies haven’t been implemented, and while we can’t see inside government officials’ minds,
we do have their official statements as to the reasons for their inaction. Here are some examples: <br>

<list cw-2-5-5 C2A; Summary; Reason;;
C2A #25; The government must allow the RCMP to investigate things that may incriminate past governments; The government has released a “Mandate Letter” regarding this and claims that that is enough, but they have yet to release any formal policy regarding this, so the issue remains.;;
C2A #58; The government must petition the Pope to formally apologize on behalf of the church for what happened in the residential schools; They have done this, but while the Pope has released several apologies since, none of them really address the required issues.;;
C2A #89; The government must amend the Physical Activity and Sport Act to improve its inclusivity to Indigenous people and activities; They government claimed in an official statement that “longer-term consultation with stakeholders is needed.”;;
> <br>

As you can see from these, the government often decides that they have completed a call to action when they haven’t even done
anything substantial. This is a problem, because no matter how effective these measures may be, Canada won’t see any of their
effects if government officials aren’t willing to complete them. <br>

There is the question, for some of these measures, of whether they’d do anything relevant to the cause. There are so many more
that haven’t been considered for other reasons, though, so here are some of those: <br>

<list cw-2-5-5 C2A; Summary; Purpose;;
C2A #18; The government must acknowledge the part that they play in the current state of Aboriginal healthcare and must recognize
the rights that they’ve ignored; This would help greatly in the process of reparation, as recognition must always be the first
step. Also, many of these rights that Indigenous people have been denied access to are things that others are receiving at the
expected rate, which speaks to exactly what that current state of government involvement is.;;
C2A #14; The government must create an Aboriginal Languages Act, including the recognition of the cultural value of Aboriginal
languages and the implementation of a plan for their revitalization; Language is a part of culture, so protecting one means
protecting the other. If the country wants to protect Indigenous culture, we’ll need their languages to survive.;;
C2A #26; The government must amend their Statutes of Limitation to stop them from justifying the Aboriginal abuse committed in
residential schools; Few of these cases are made any more “correct” by the continued existence of these policies, and to reject
them all without consideration of circumstances is wrong.;;
C2A #8; The government must eliminate the discrepancy between funding for on- and off-reserve Indigenous education; This is
unquestionably necessary, as until Indigenous people are truly free to express their culture in any place without losing out
on the things that others receive, it can’t reasonably be said that they are given the same opportunity as others.;;
> <br>

Reading through these should give some perspective on just how much these calls to action cover, and just how important it is
that they are implemented. <br>

There’s still the issue of how exactly these policies would be enacted, as without a plan we can’t do anything with them.
Luckily, there are a lot of calls to action for which this isn’t the case. Most of the calls ask for something very specific,
and there’s a clear process that would be involved with completing them. For some examples, see the following: <br>

<list cw-2-5-5 C2A; Summary; Action;;
C2A #9; The government must release annual reports that compare the funding that on- and off-reserve education receives, as
well as the average income of Aboriginals and others; This call to action is direct, to-the-point, and all that’s needed to
pull it off is a small committee and a minor amount of funding per year.;;
C2A #30; The government must commit to reducing the percentage of Indigenous people in custody to a number that better reflects
their overall population, and monitor this percentage over the next 10 years; This is another simple case of “make a committee,
give them some funding, and let them tell you how you’re doing,” with a couple of policies added on to help Indigenous people
avoid a criminal lifestyle and to stop the overpolicing that they see.;;
C2A #47; The government must deny the things that were used to justify European ownership of Indigenous property and people,
like the Doctrine of Discovery; This doesn’t even need any new policy, just the removal of some old ones that weren’t even
really laws to begin with!;;
> <br>

Clearly, there are several easy starting points for these calls to action. For some reason, though, the government seems set
on not taking any of them, or many other easy yet relevant options. That must seem at least a little strange. <br>

<img https://librarianship.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/93.jpg> <class text-center fst-italic; An example of a call to action>

One potential explanation for the government’s vast inaction on these 94 things they’ve agreed to do is that they would simply
take more effort than they’d return in value. While that could be seen through some lens as valid, there are plenty of
counterexamples. For instance, there are these: <br>

<list cw-2-5-5 C2A; Summary; Is it Reasonable?;;
C2A #18; The government must acknowledge the part that they play in the current state of Aboriginal healthcare and must recognize the rights that they’ve ignored; This one has been covered earlier in this article, but government acknowledgement of this issue is so important that it seems reasonable to talk about it twice. The government officials’ predecessors are at fault for a lot of this, and while they continue to be inactive on it, so are they.;;
C2A #32; The government must change their criminal code to allow judges to ignore the minimum sentence for specific crimes; If the duty of a court is to decide on reasonable sentences for crimes, is it not reasonable to allow them to decide on less if they believe that the defendant deserves less, especially if they aren’t entirely morally at fault?;;
C2A #3; The government must implement Jordan’s Principle, the idea that Indigenous children should be given the same access to public services that any others receive; This is another call to action that is important enough that it’s deserving of more than one entry discussing it. It’s also a member of the small set of calls that are being actively worked on, which would be good if any real progress were being made. Though technically it’s “in progress,” not a whole lot is getting done. Either way, the full completion of this one would have a huge impact on the current state of reconciliation. The path back to equality includes finding it for children, too.;;
> <br>

With that in mind, any questions of usefulness for effort should have landed squarely on the side of “these are worthwhile and
would give more than enough value to make up for what was expended to get there.” <br>
Ultimately, the government could be doing a lot more than they currently are. One big thing to think about, then, is this:
Suppose that they did take more action on these 94, enough that they complete them all in the relatively near future. Although
nobody can see the future, here’s what seems like the most likely outcome based on current evidence. Firstly, the main thing that
the 94 calls to action aim for is to aid the Indigenous healing process from colonization and from residential schools, and they
would be very efficient at accomplishing that if they were implemented. There are two main ways that they are intended to do this,
those being the acknowledgement of the full history of these events, and the creation of a system to reduce the longstanding
negative impacts that they’ve left behind. If the Indigenous population were to receive the proper help that they deserve from
the government, it’s likely that the relationship between the two groups would improve greatly, as a lot of the tensions that
exist between them are due to the lack of real handling of these issues. Overall, if Canada managed to reach all these 94 targets
that have been set out for them, the country would be a much more equal place, at least legally speaking. While that doesn’t
necessarily imply true social equality, it’s certainly a necessary first step. <br>

After reading through all of this, I hope that you recognize the extent to which the Canadian government is ignoring its many
options for reconciliation, but as a final thought, what might be the holdup? This was covered to some extent earlier, but to
give a better analysis of it, it needs to be looked at more generally, to see the trends. As it stands, there are a lot of
cases where the government chooses to believe that they have completed a call to action when they’ve accomplished very little.
This was discussed earlier, but another big issue is that sometimes when the federal government releases an answer to a call
to action, it takes the provincial and regional governments an unnecessary amount of time to recognize it themselves. For
instance, when the federal government marked Truth and Reconciliation Day, very few of the provinces chose to do the same,
and in a lot of cases it still doesn’t apply to everyone. Clearly, there’s a problem somewhere, as if the government can’t
even do the things that they’ve already decided on for reconciliation, something must have broken down. In conclusion, the
efforts to put an end to the damage caused by colonizers’ actions are left far behind where they should be, and it’s left
Indigenous people in a state of severe inequality with seemingly no government effort to help them escape they cycles that
they’ve been put in. <br>

<class fw-bold text-center fs-3; TL, DR:
    <class text-center; The next passage is meant to summarize everything that has been discussed in this article.>
>
The issues caused by residential schools didn’t simply end with their survivors. They continue to persist in a very real
way to this day, and they aren’t going to go away if nothing is done about them. To help combat these issues, which include
things like a cycle of parents abusing their children, generation-spanning poverty, and a continued prejudice held by many
people against their very culture, the government created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which in turn released
a report containing 94 calls to action. The government agreed that they would put effort into reaching each of these
goals, but in the 7 years since, the government hasn’t completed more than 13 of them, and has only started work on another 29.
There seems to be no reason for this, as the calls aren’t inherently unreasonable, and if completed, they would be highly
effective in aiding the reconciliation efforts. It seems that the only reason that they aren’t being completed is that the
government has chosen not to prioritize it, though there's also several calls that they claim to have completed, but have
only barely started. They have the funding, they have the people who want it, and they can tell whether they’ve reached
the goals or not (even if they choose to ignore it), so it’s unclear what they are waiting for. Until we see substantial
progress, it can only be assumed that they won’t act on these calls in any substantial way, and that they won’t give a direct reason for it. Knowing
this, one big thing that you can do after taking it all in is to investigate why exactly it is that they haven’t done what they
can to help. Maybe you’ll even find something that gives you reason to consider taking action yourself. <br>
